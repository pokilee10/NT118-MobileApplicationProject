    <string name="date">A thin wrapper around a millisecond value that allows JDBC to identify this as an SQL DATE
        value. A milliseconds value represents the number of milliseconds that have passed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00.000 GMT.
        To conform with the definition of SQL DATE, the millisecond values wrapped by a java.sql.Date instance
        must be normalized by setting the hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds to zero in the particular time zone with which the instance is associated.

    <string name="rating">A RatingBar is an extension of SeekBar and ProgressBar that shows a rating in stars.
        The user can touch/drag or use arrow keys to set the rating when using the default size RatingBar.
        The smaller RatingBar style ( R.attr.ratingBarStyleSmall) and the larger indicator-only style
        (R.attr.ratingBarStyleIndicator) do not support user interaction and should only be used as indicators.
        When using a RatingBar that supports user interaction, placing widgets to the left or right of the
        RatingBar is discouraged.</string>
    <string name="edit">A TextView displays text to the user and optionally allows them to edit it.

    <string name="recyclerview">RecyclerView is the ViewGroup that contains the views corresponding to your data.
        Its a view itself so you add RecyclerView into your layout the way you would add any other UI element.
        Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object.
        RecyclerView is a ViewGroup added to the android studio as a successor of the GridView and ListView.
        It is an improvement on both of them and can be found in the latest v-7 support packages.
        It has been created to make possible construction of any lists with XML layouts as an item
        which can be customized vastly while improving on the efficiency of ListViews and GridViews.
